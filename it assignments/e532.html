<p style="color:white">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on th
    e internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
     development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused
      on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s,
     design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
